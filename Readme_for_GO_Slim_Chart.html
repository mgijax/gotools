     Background and Description</h2>
       
<blockquote>            
  <p>The Gene Ontology (GO) project was established to  provide a common language
 to describe aspects of a gene product's biology.  A gene product's biology
 is represented by three independent structured, controlled vocabularies:
   molecular function, biological process and cellular component.  For more
  information on GO, see the <a href="http://www.geneontology.org">GO consortium
  home page</a>
        .   </p>
               
  <p> To provide the most detailed information available, gene products are 
     annotated to the most granular GO term(s) possible. For example, if a
 gene   product is localized to the <b>perinuclear space</b>, it will be annotated
    to that specific term only and not the parent term <b>nucleus</b> . In
this    example the term <b> perinuclear space</b> is a child of <b> nucleus</b>
     .    However, for many purposes, such as analyzing the results of microarray
   expression data, it is very useful to "calculate" on GO, moving up the
GO   tree from the specific terms used to annotate the genes in a list to
find   GO parent terms that the genes may have in common.  The GO Term Finder
tool   allows you to do this. </p>

     Query Page</h2>
               
  <blockquote>    The <a href="MGI_GO_Slim_Chart.html">
         query page</a>
           allows you to enter the list of gene names and select the ontology 
  that   you want to search.                               
    <ol>
          <li><b>Enter gene names:</b><br>
           You can either type the name of the genes in the input box or
upload    a  file  that contains the genes names.  Note that a long (more
than 100   genes)  list of genes might take awhile to return your results.
      </li>
          <li><b>Choose ontology:</b><br>
           Select one of the three (biological process, molecular function, 
 or  cellular   component) ontologies by checking the boxes. This tool is 
designed  to search   only one of the three ontologies at a given time in 
order to minimize the   searching time.  </li>
          <li><b>Indicate whether to include IEAs</b>:&nbsp;The IEA code, 
        <b>   I</b>     nferred from <b>E</b>lectronic <b>A</b>nnotation, 
means no human  involvement   in the assignment of the association and is 
thus lowest quality  evidence  code. IEA is the only code currently in use 
that does not require  human judgement   during the curation process. Also 
see the <a href="http://www.geneontology.org/doc/GO.evidence.html">      
 GO evidence code</a>
          documentation.&nbsp;</li>

     Results</h2>
                       
    <blockquote>The results page displays in table form, the distribution
  of genes in pre-defined bins (see <a href="MGI_GO_Slim.html">
   MGI GO_Slim definitions</a>
   ) and a comparison with the overall distribution of all MGI annotated
genes.  The results page also shows the ontology and annoatation versions
used.<br>
